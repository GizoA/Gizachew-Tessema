I published \>115 peer-reviewed journal articles, and the remaining are working paper and a policy brief. I was first, second or last author for over 60 articles. As part of the Ethiopian National Burden of Diseases (ENBD) team
where I was vice chair, I led and coordinated 10 publications using GBD methods in Ethiopia.
